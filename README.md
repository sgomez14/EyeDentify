# EyeDentify
- EyeDentify is an app that allows users to identify objects in their environment by taking pictures. 

- Our app uses computer vision algorithms to generate a vibrant description of the object scanned. 

- It also employs optical character recognition to detect words on the object. 

- A user can also provide a voice memo that gets attached to the results of that object. 

- This information is paired with a near field communication (NFC) tag so that a user can easily access that objectâ€™s description at a later timer by scanning the tag. 

- This app is designed for users that are blind or have other visual impairments. But, it is useful to both sighted and non-sighted users alike.

The TagAcitivty screen will display the results from our computer vision algorithm. The screen is shown below. CloudSight provides results for the "Item Description" and Google MLKit provides OCR results for "Item Keywords."
