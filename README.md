# EyeDentify
- EyeDentify is an app that allows users to identify objects in their environment by taking pictures. 

- Our app uses computer vision algorithms to generate a vibrant description of the object scanned. 

- It also employs optical character recognition to detect words on the object. 

- A user can also provide a voice memo that gets attached to the results of that object. 

- This information is paired with a near field communication (NFC) tag so that a user can easily access that objectâ€™s description at a later timer by scanning the tag. 

- This app is designed for users that are blind or have other visual impairments. But, it is useful to both sighted and non-sighted users alike.

The TagAcitivty screen will display the results from our computer vision algorithm. The screen is shown below. CloudSight provides results for the "Item Description" and Google MLKit provides OCR results for "Item Keywords."

You can edit the "Item Description" and "Item Keywords" text fields by tapping on them an using the phone's keyword. Alternatively, you can edit the fields with Speech-to-Text (STT). You activate STT by tapping and holding on the field. This will make the phone vibrate and you speak the words you want in the field.


The "Scan Item with Camera" button allows you to retake the photo of the item.


The "Add Voice Memo" button enables a user to record a voice memo to pair with the tag. Activate recording by tapping and holding onto the "Add Voice Memo" button. The phone will vibrate and you can commence recording. Letting go of the buttons stops the recording. A Toast will appear to signal that recording ended. To remove the voice recording, simply shake the phone. A Toast will to show on screen to state the memo was removed.


The "Pair with Tag" button initiates the tag pairing process. Tap this button to pair information with an NFC tag.


Now the "Listening to a Tag" screen will show. A Toast will also appear warning that information that exists on an NFC tag will be overwritten. You can now tap your NFC tag to the back of the phone, which is the typically location of the NFC sensor. Another Toast shows up if there is an error reading the tag.
