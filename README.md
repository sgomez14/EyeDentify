# EyeDentify
- EyeDentify is an app that allows users to identify objects in their environment by taking pictures. 

- Our app uses computer vision algorithms to generate a vibrant description of the object scanned. 

- It also employs optical character recognition to detect words on the object. 

- A user can also provide a voice memo that gets attached to the results of that object. 

- This information is paired with a near field communication (NFC) tag so that a user can easily access that objectâ€™s description at a later timer by scanning the tag. 

- This app is designed for users that are blind or have other visual impairments. But, it is useful to both sighted and non-sighted users alike.
